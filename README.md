Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software Engineering is the systematic applicattion of engineering principles, methodologies and tools in the designing, develoment and 
maintenance of high quality software systems. It is vital to the technology industry as it provides the software applications that drives commerce, entertainment, finance and healthcare. 

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1) The development of programming languages;
2) Making Software Engineering a discpline on it own
3) Introduction of Agile methodologies in the 2000s

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
i) REQUIREMENTS - getting to know exactly what the client wants and documenting it
ii) DESIGNING - Coming up with the an holistic solution and design architecture for the project
iii) DEVELOPMENT - writing the codes according to the solution and architecture designed
iv) TESTING - Ensuring the software developed is working according to expectations
v) DEPLOYMENT - Getting the product to end users
vi) MAINTENANCE - Giving necessary support, updates, upgrades to the client


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
COMPARISON -  
Waterfall Methodologies: Sequential in appraoch; Customer has no access to product until testing phase; Major version release requires a long to process and Changing requirement during development is hard or even impossible.
Agile Methodologies: Iterative and cyclical in approach; Accomodates changes; Each phase is short; Teams work in cycles or sprints; Unit Testing happens in each sprint to minimize risk of failure; At the end of each sprint, a chunk of working code is released called the sprint demo (stakeholders see the functionalities and provide feedback)
; After several sprint cycle, a Minimul Viable Product (MVP) is released.
USE CASES
Waterfall: building a car or similar product
Agile: Most software or similar tech product

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
SOFTWARE ENGINEER: Writing the codes and implementing the software solution
QUALITY ASSURANCE ENGINNER: Ensures the software meets the expected standard by designing plans and tests to check the quality of the software.
PROJECT MANAGER: Guides the project through the initiation, planning, exection and conclusion phases.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IDEs provide tools for the writing, debugging and testing of codes (Example VS-Code, Spider) while VCS provides tools to monitor changes to source codes and team collaboration 
(e.g. Git)

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Common challenges: Changes required during the process; Tight deadlines and Technical debts.
To over them the software engineers need effective communication, agile methodologies and priotization of tasks amonst others.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
UNIT TESTING - This has to do with testing individual component or modules in a software. This ensures that they are functioning as expected.
INTEGRATION TESTING - This checks the interations of compnents or modules with others in the system. 
SYSTEM TESTING - This test the whole system. This ensures the whole system's functionality.
ACCEPTANCE TESTING - This to check if the software produced meets the user's requirements.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is the crafting of prompts usually questions in a way to get the best response from the AI model. 
No matter how powerful the AI model used it response is limited by the quality of our propmts!

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.

VAGUE PROMPT: "Recommend a book"
IMPROVED PROMPT: "Give me a list of the top 10 books on AI"

I actually tried this on Copilot: The first prompt gave me a list of 10 books across genres and I find only one that drew my curiosity. The improved prompt is more focused and provided 
results in which I find all the books recommended interesting.
